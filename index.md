# Welcome

Welcome to Open Tech School's HTML & CSS workshop! This course is a simple
and comprehensive guide dedicated to helping beginners learn HTML and CSS.

**HTML or HyperText Markup Language** is the main markup language for creating
web pages and other information that can be displayed in a web browser.
You can write your web application in any programming languages, but in the
end it will always be transformed into HTML because that's the language of
the browser. It is a hierarchical language.

And **HTML5**? What's that?
This is just the latest version of HTML. There is a lot of interest
about it, because it improves and adds many HTML elements, making it
easier to write and to use.

**What about CSS?**
CSS or Cascading Style Sheets is a language used for describing the
look and formatting of a document written in a markup language.
It is closely connected with HTML, since it gives style to HTML elements.
In contrast to HTML, CSS has no hierarchy and can be written in the order
that we choose.

**CSS3** is the last released version of CSS, and it also
improves CSS a lot. For example, it gives the possibility to animate
an element.

To check all our code, we will use the console in our browser.
Open any browser and check under 'Tools'. You should find a 'Developer tools'
or similar option. Click it, and the toolbox will be opened.
Here is the place where we can monitor our code and see whether it works
or not. Don't worry! We will explain this better later; for now it is
important that you know where to find your console and how to open it.

## What we'll do today

Today we will learn how to write a web page with HTML and style it with CSS.
Our goal is to create a personal portfolio page with a
presentation and contact page.

Once you are done with your personal portfolio, you can explore some
interesting links that you can find below the 'Extra' section.
If you're extra curious once you are done with the portfolio, these resources
will help you to keep coding with HTML and CSS or just keep you updated
about what's next.
