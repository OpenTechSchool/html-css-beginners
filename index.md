title: Social Coding with GitHub

---

This is the course content for Social Coding with GitHub, which has
been developed and maintained by OpenTechSchool.

# Welcome

Welcome to social coding with GitHub! This course is intended to introduce
beginners to the social side of programming. We'll be looking at one of the
most popular sites for social programming: GitHub.

We'll be using Git, a popular tool for storing and sharing source
code. It's a tool that keeps a copy of your source code, but not just
one copy. It keeps track of every version of every file in a repository. In addition
we'll also use GitHub to host your Git repositories online for you.

## What we'll do today

There are two parts to the course today. The first is the core content. This is
to get you up and running with Git and GitHub. We'll create a simple repository
and show you how to get it on GitHub. The second part are all optional extras.
There are a few really neat things that you can do with GitHub, so we've
prepared these extra topics for you to explore and try out if you find them
interesting. You can do as many or as few of the optional extras as you please.

## A bit of history

Git was created in 2005 by Linus Torvalds (who is also the creator of Linux).
Linus was looking for an easy way to manage source code for Linux, which has
thousands of developers all over the world. Frustrated with current tools, he
wrote the first version of Git during a cross-Atlantic flight. It quickly
became the defacto tool for storing and sharing source code thanks to its
quick speed and versatility.

In 2008 GitHub launched. It allowed developers to share their Git repositories
online free of charge. By September 2012 it was hosting 3.7 million repositories
and had 2.1 million users. One of the key features of GitHub is the ability to
"fork" or copy the repositories of other users. After forking, users can make
changes locally and send a "pull request" to the original owner, allowing them
to pull the changes back into their repository. This made following and contributing
to projects significantly easier, and GitHub quickly became the place to be if
you want to share your source code and contribute to other projects.
