# Welcome

Welcome to Open Tech School’s HTML & CSS workshop! This course is a simple 
and comprehensive guide dedicated to helping beginners learn HTML and CSS.

**HTML or HyperText Markup Language** is the main markup language for creating 
web pages and other information that can be displayed in a web browser. 
You can write your web application in any programming languages, but in the 
end it will always be transformed into HTML because that’s the language of 
the browser. It is a hierarchical language.

**A short bit of history**
HTML was developed at the CERN in Switzerland. Its inventor is Tim
Berners-Lee. In 1980 he wrote his first hypertext system for personal
use - the predecessor of HTML. With the first browser and server software
the very young internet and HTML made their way to conquer the world.
In 1992 two copies of a free web browser were downloaded from a computer
at CERN to a computer in the USA. In 1995 the first Internet Explorer was
published.

And **HTML5**? What’s that?  
This is just the latest version of HTML. There is a lot of interest 
about it, because it improves and adds many HTML elements, making it 
easier to write and to use.

**What about CSS?**  
CSS or Cascading Style Sheets is a language used for describing the 
look and formatting of a document written in a markup language. 
It is closely connected with HTML, since it gives style to HTML elements. 
In contrast to HTML, CSS has no hierarchy and can be written in the order 
that we choose.

**CSS3** is the last released version of CSS, and it also 
improves CSS a lot. For example, it gives the possibility to animate 
an element.

## What we’ll do today

Today we will learn how to write a web page with HTML and style it with CSS. 
Our goal is to create a personal portfolio page with a 
presentation and contact page.

Once you are done with your personal portfolio, you can explore some 
interesting links that you can find below the “Extra” section. 
If you’re extra curious once you are done with the portfolio, these resources 
will help you to keep coding with HTML and CSS or just keep you updated 
about what’s next.
