## Preamble: How to write a HTML document

This is actually pretty simple: HTML is written as a plain text document.
A HTML file always uses the extension **.html** to indicate its filetype.

## Text editor
You will need a plain text editor in order to edit HTML files.

You can also get fully graphical WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) 
HTML editors, that let you edit the web page graphically with a similar 
interface to programs like Word. These can be useful, but many people 
working with HTML & CSS prefer a plain text editor and that's what we'll 
be using today.

If you already have a plain text editor installed (perhaps from a previous 
OTS workshop) then you'll be fine. Otherwise here are some suggestions:

### Windows

[Notepad++](http://www.notepad-plus-plus.org/) is free and suitable, 
or you could try [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/).

### OS X

[TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/) is free 
and suitable. Other good choices (with a few more advanced features you can 
grow into) include [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) or 
[Text Mate](http://macromates.com/).

### Linux

GEdit comes pre-installed on many Linux distributions. Otherwise you might want
to try [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) or one of the dozens of
other text editors available on Linux.

**Text editor up and running? Great, time to create an HTML document!**

## Doctype

The ﬁrst thing on an HTML page is the **doctype**, which as you might guess, 
tells the browser what type of document it's looking at, and how to read it.

Thankfully, HTML5's doctype is extremely simple - it's just `html`.

Open a new file in your editor and write this line first:

    <!DOCTYPE html>

Then save it with the file extension `.html`. You're now officially editing 
an html document!

## Structuring your project

You can create your HTML files anywhere you like, but we recommend you use 
directories to organise things so they're easy to find later.

* Create a directory somewhere (your home folder, or your desktop) for this 
  workshop. Name it something like *OTS_HTML_Workshop*.

* Create another directory inside that one for this first exercise. Name it 
  something like *exercise1*.

* From inside your editor, save your first HTML file inside the *exercise1*
  directory. Name it something like *page.html*.

As time goes by, we will be adding more files to this directory and eventually
adding whole new directories alongside exercise1 for new projects.


## Elements and Tags

These are the basic building blocks of HTML.

**Elements** *are* what makes up a HTML document. Because you can have zero, 
one or more elements inside another, this is what makes HTML *heirarchical*. 
An element can include three things: a tag, attributes, and content.

A **Tag** is the thing that indicates an element's purpose. For example, 
the `<p>` tag indicates a paragraph of text is in that element, and the `<li>` 
represents a 'list item'. You'll notice they're always surrounded by angle 
backets. *Opening* and *Closing* tags mark the beginning and end of an 
element and wrap its content, like so:

    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

You can see the closing tag includes a `/` before its name; otherwise it would 
be another opening tag!

**Always** double-check that you've closed all your elements; otherwise, a 
browser can and will get mixed up trying to understand your HTML document.

There are some specific elements that are exceptions to this rule. 
When elements cannot contain anything else, then they don't need to be closed. 
For example, the following elements are referred to as 'self-closing':

    <hr>
    <input>
    <img>

There aren't so many of such elements, and you should easily pick up which are 
which by writing some more code :)

Lastly, *nesting* elements isn't so hard, and is fundamental to how HTML works. 
It looks just like this:

    <p>This is a sentence, with a <span>span</span> element inside it.</p>

or this:

    <div id="first-heading">
        <h1>The h1 tags indicates the primary header of the document</h1>
    </div>

You'll notice that HTML doesn't actually care about the whitespace or 
newlines *between* tags. It would end up looking the same if the above had 
been fit onto one line.

In the above example, you can see our first case of an **attribute**. It 
starts with a lowercase name, and then is almost always followed by an 
`=` and a 'value' that's surrounded in double quotes, `"like this"`. An element 
can have many attributes, in which case you separate them by spaces, as you'll 
see soon. Attributes give information about an element in particular.

In this case, the `<div>` tag (which is used to *divide* groups of elements up)
has an `id` attribute assigned to `first-heading`. That's telling us that this 
section of the document is designed to hold the  first heading shown on the 
page. You will learn more about specific attributes later!

## Html and Head Elements

Coming back to our file (hope you're coding along!), after the doctype we 
begin our document with a root `html` element, just like so:

    <html>
    </html>

It encompasses every other element in our HTML document, nothing should go 
outside it! Next, the document is broken up into two important parts: 
The **head** and **body**.

The head contains the title of the page & information **about** the page 
(*meta* information). Most meta information isn't visible to the user, 
but it has many purposes. For example, meta elements can tell search engines 
information about your page, such as who created it and a description of 
your page's content. Here's an example `head` element:

    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8"> 
        <meta name="description" content="Free Web tutorials">
        <title>My first Portfolio</title>
    </head>

You can see meta tags are one of the self-closing elements! 
First off, there is a charset meta tag. 
This is the most important meta tag. Without it your website might not display 
properly. It is best practice to include it as the first element inside the 
head element. Basically, it specifies to the browser the character encoding 
for the HTML document. That means your browser will be able to read and 
correctly display all the special characters such as €, $, è and so on. `UTF-8` 
is usually the best general encoding to use.

Here we've also written another type of a meta tag, the description. 
We define what kind of meta tag it is with the `name` attribute and put our 
description in the *value* of the content attribute.

Inside our head element, we have lastly written a title of our website. Chuck 
the above code in your file (inside your `html` element), and change the 
content of the `<title>`. Then you can check your document by opening your 
file in a browser and looking at what is written in your browser toolbar. 
That also provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites.

Head tags can also include external files or resources, such as CSS or 
JavaScript files. We will see later how to do this.

## The Body

Finally, we are at the place where our content goes. 
The body contains the actual content of the page. Everything that is 
contained in the body is visible to the user.

Just after the closing head tag but still inside the html element, 
let's add the body tags.

    <body>
    </body>

Everything that is written inside this tag will be displayed to the user. 
Add a `<body>` to your existing HTML document and then write some 
plain text between the body tags and view it in your browser.

**TIP**: To reload the same HTML document in the browser, use the Reload 
Current Page function (Ctrl-R or F5)

## Types of content

There are different HTML elements that we can use to indicate different types 
of content in our document, like the <p></p> tags which we have already met.
Let's try writing a title, followed by a paragraph.

    <body>
        <h1>I'm the title.</h1>
        <p>And I'm a paragraph!</p>
    </body>

Heading elements are straightforward to understand. They start from h1 with the 
biggest font and importance, going to h6 with the smallest font.

## Indentation

Are you wondering why we wrote the h1 and p tags *indented* inside 
the body tags?

That will not change at all how the browser reads or interpretates the 
document, but it is a good practice among developers to write code like that 
in order to have a more clear document and still be able to work with it 
even after a long time or when there is a lot of lines of code. It also shows 
the heircharcical nature of HTML pretty well.

## Comments

It is also possible to put "comments" in your HTML. Comments in HTML are there 
to remind you (or other people editing the HTML file) without changing the way 
the page displays in a browser.

Like other HTML elements, comments are written by using a tag. Although comment 
tags look a little different:

    <!-- I am a comment -->

The "start comment" tag is `<!--` and the "end comment" tag is `-->`.

Comments can also enclose other HTML elements, to "comment them out". This is a 
useful technique when you're experimenting with a page to see how it looks when 
you change things around.

For example, try commenting out the `h1` heading in your current page:

    <body>
        <!-- <h1>I'm the title.</h1> -->
        <p>And I'm a paragraph!</p>
    </body>

If you reload the page in your browser, you'll notice the heading has vanished.

Remove the comment tags (so the heading appears again) before moving on to the 
next section.

## Images

Headings and paragraphs give you the basics of text. What about images?

Images have to kept in separate image files, outside the HTML file. Find a 
favourite image on the web and save it in the same directory as your HTML 
file (right-click the image in your browser and "Save Image...").

If you don't have a picture in mind then
[here's a page with a photo of some kittens that you can use](http://www.flickr.com/photos/nengard/67501122/sizes/s/)
(Cute cats on the internet? Egad!)

After you have your image, you can include it in your HTML page by using an 
`<img>` tag.

    <img src="kittens.jpg">

Add the `<img>` tag anywhere inside the "body" of your HTML document where 
you'd like the image to appear. Replace "kittens.jpg" with the file name 
of the image that you saved in the same directory as the HTML file.

Notice that `<img>` is one of the tags that doesn't need a sepaate closing 
tag. You could put `</img>` after the tag if you like, it doesn't change 
the way the browser views the page.

**TIP:** The image source name ("src") of `kittens.jpg` is a path relative 
to the HTML document. So in this case `kittens.jpg` is located in the same 
directory, but you could use a name like `"images/kittens.jpg"` if you 
put the image file into a subdirectory called "images". You can even 
use full URLs like  `"http://myawesomesite.com/pictures/kittens.jpg"`, 
but it's best to avoid this if you can use a relative path instead.

### Alt Text

A good habit to get into is using "alt text" to describe the contents of 
an image:

    <img src="kittens.jpg" alt="Some kittens">

The alt text is a textual description of what's in the image. This is important 
for anyone who can't see the images (for instance vision impaired people using 
a screenreader.) Any image that isn't purely decorative should have a description 
set with the "alt=" attribute.

## Putting it all together

So far, our entire document might look like this:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <meta charset="UTF-8"> 
            <meta name="description" content="Free Web tutorials">
            <title>My first Portfolio</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1>I'm the title.</h1>
            <p>And I'm a paragraph!</p>
            <p>
                 <img src="kittens.jpg" alt="All the kittens are shown here">
            </p>
            <h3>This is a sub-heading...</h3>
            <p>Well now we're just blathering on.</p>
        </body>
    </html>


Notice that the kitten image is part of its own paragraph here, so it is
shown on a new line in the browser.

Hopefully the document in your file looks similar, but not exactly the same. 
You might have changed some of the text... does it all work in your browser?

## Why not use Word?

You might wonder why you're writing all these elements by hand, 
when you could make up the same stuff in a Word document.

Well, think about some of the cooler websites around that you've seen on the 
web, and their complex layouts. Do you think you could replicate them 
using Word? How long might it take? That's the power of manual control that 
HTML (and CSS, and Javascript) gives to the web and web developers. You can 
learn it too!

## What's next?

You may be thinking at this stage that your HTML page looks pretty bland. 
How can you spice it up a little?
